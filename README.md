OpenBrailleInput
================

OpenBraille is an Input Method for Android mobile devices that draws inspiration from BrailleTouch‘s (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brailletouch/id579725651?mt=8) usage setup (screen facing away the user), combined with finger recognition/tracking techniques from Perkinput (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/perkinput/id767748170?mt=8). Currently the method works as any other system-wide 3rd party keyboard and supports grade 1 Braille; HOWEVER, it can’t be used in combination with TalkBack, due to Android’s technical limitations. As it is, TalkBack needs to be deactivated to use OpenBraille.
